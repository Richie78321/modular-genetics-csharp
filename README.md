# modular-genetics
A library for genetically evolving complex operators.

The goal of this library is to abstract all genetic algorithm processes, including: initial genome generation, fitness selection, and genetic reproduction and mutation.
This library also preserves the possibility for realtime genetic evolution in contrast to the traditional method of artificial evaluation and selection.
